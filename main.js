    "Whenever you read a good book, it's like the author is right there, in the room, talking to you, which is why I don't like to read good books.",
    "Instead of putting a quarter under a kid's pillow, how about a pinecone? That way, he learns that \"wishing\" isn't going to save our national forests.",
    "Isn't it funny how one minute life can be such a struggle, and the next minute you're just driving real fast, swerving back and forth across the road?",
    "Instead of having \"answers\" on a math test, they should just call them \"impressions,\" and if you got a different \"impression,\" so what, can't we all be brothers?",

    "The first time I ever tried to milk a cow at Grandpa's farm, I didn't even know which end of the cow to milk! Then I guess I got even dumber, because the next time I couldn't even find the barn. Then the last time, I just went out in the woods and lived, with no clothes.",
    "If I could be any kind of dog, I think I'd be one of those little yappy dogs, because while you're sitting there on the couch trying to sound real smart, I'm just yapping away. Just yappin' and yappin', and there's nothing you can do about it, because I live here.",

    "When the tire blew out on Gary's car, he and Bob got out and fixed it. But they had only driven a few miles when another tire blew out. \"Well, I guess I'm the blowout king,\" said Gary. Bob tried to smile, but it was hard. He had always thought of himself as the blowout king.",
    "When I pick up a handful of sand at the beach and let it dribble through my fingers, I think, Man, this is not a very good vacation.",
    "Aunt Lucy always used to win first prize at the county fair for her apple pie. It wasn't a real county fair - that's just what they called it at the mental home where she lived. And it wasn't a real apple pie either. Usually it was a ball of dough with tongue depressors and pieces of gum sticking out of it. Still, she won.",
