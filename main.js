    "When the tire blew out on Gary's car, he and Bob got out and fixed it. But they had only driven a few miles when another tire blew out. \"Well, I guess I'm the blowout king,\" said Gary. Bob tried to smile, but it was hard. He had always thought of himself as the blowout king.",
    "When I pick up a handful of sand at the beach and let it dribble through my fingers, I think, Man, this is not a very good vacation.",
    "Aunt Lucy always used to win first prize at the county fair for her apple pie. It wasn't a real county fair - that's just what they called it at the mental home where she lived. And it wasn't a real apple pie either. Usually it was a ball of dough with tongue depressors and pieces of gum sticking out of it. Still, she won.",
